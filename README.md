This project is a foundatinoal multiple choice game. This style of game can be replicated using other questions or less answers or in different ways jsut by adjusting a bit of code.
This game once started, counts down from 20 and once the time is up, it's game over. As well as the time limit, there is a punishment for selecting an incorrect answer in the form of a time penalty of one second for each wrong click. This
Once the game is over, either by you answering all questions correctly or by the time being up, you will be navigated to the highscores screen, where you will be presented with the score that you got, and asked to put some initials or a name to correspond with that score. Upon submitting by clicking save, your score will be added to the high scores list ONLY if it is in the top 5 highest scores stored, as only 5 are dispalyed and this is the top 5.
Once submitting you may click play again. you can also navigate to the highscores page and check the scores as you wish aswell with the view highscores link.
